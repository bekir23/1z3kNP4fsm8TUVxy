# Term Deposit Marketing


## Data Description:<br/>
The data comes from direct marketing efforts of a European banking institution. The marketing campaign involves making a phone call to a customer, often multiple times to ensure a product subscription, in this case a term deposit. Term deposits are usually short-term deposits with maturities ranging from one month to a few years. The customer must understand when buying a term deposit that they can withdraw their funds only after the term ends. All customer information that might reveal personal information is removed due to privacy concerns.
